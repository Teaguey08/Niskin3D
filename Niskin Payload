This is a Niskin sampling Device for OpenROV platform. The original design for the Niskin is fromAndrewThaler found at https://www.youmagine.com/designs/niskin3d-water-sampler. I modified it and changed some parts to make it work for myself. I followed his in instructions on http://www.southernfriedscience.com/?p=18730

This is a remix to fit an OpenROV Payload Rail System from PaulMarineRPS http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1025771. The attachments to the Niksin areGo Pro Picatinny Rail Mounts from lazerusrm http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:103878.

Its a mish mash of all these components.
